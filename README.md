#Anti-theft Vehicle Tracking System 

This Project uses the GPS module to detect the location of the vehicle, GPS sends the coordinates to a server
and the system uses this co-ordinate to plot the current location of the vehicle on the website. So, the user 
can track the location of there vehicle. In this, we use the concept of parking if the user's vehicle is parked
and if any theft activity occurs then the system alert the user by message and the user can avoid own vehicle 
from theft by taking some action at an instant.
